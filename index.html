		<p><b>Sacred Heart College of Lucena City is an educational institution in Lucena City, Quezon, Philippines. The first catholic learning institution in Quezon Province, it was founded on April 27, 1884. It had its roots in the vision of a simple and saintly woman named Hermana Fausta Labrador whose exemplary life was moulded on the Vincentian spirituality. The school grew and its status was changed from Academy to College in 1941. It was formally turned-over to the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul on August 14, 1937. The school's basic education division offers primary and secondary education from kindergarten through grade 12. The higher education division offers courses leading to associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees.</b></p>
